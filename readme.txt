balancebook is a simple web application created for individuals interested in reflecting over their daily lives and using simple data points to track their overall health.
The idea is pretty simple. Rate how you are feeling about the different areas of your life and give a short note of what's on your mind. You can then track these different areas
from a data standpoint, and go over your notes in the library section of the application. My hope is that this tool could help people clear their minds and live a more balanced life,
even though I created it mostly for my own well-being. I use methods like these on a daily basis and I believe everyone would benefit from evaluating their everyday state of mind more regularly. Enjoy!
